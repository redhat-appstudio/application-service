# Release

The application-service repository does not do GitHub releases at the moment. Consumers of the application-service Go module are expected to update to the latest commit on a frequent basis. 

Any depreceation or breaking changes are documented as part of the code change in the PR or the function description.

Since application-service is part of the AppStudio project, code commits to the application-service repository are automatically added to the [infra-deployments](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments/tree/main/components/has) repository.
