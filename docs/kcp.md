# Running HAS in KCP

## Prereqs

- Access to a hosted KCP environment
- An active KCP workspace, with an OpenShift-based `SyncTarget` inside it.

## Before Deployment

Before you deploy HAS on KCP, make sure you create the `has-github-token` secret in the namespace you will be deploying HAS within:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic has-github-token --from-literal=token=$TOKEN -n application-service-system
```

If `kubectl` complains that `application-service-system` does not exist, create it, and then retry the command.

where `$TOKEN` is the GitHub token to be used with HAS, as described [here](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/application-service#creating-a-github-secret-for-has).

## Deploying the Operator

To deploy HAS on KCP, just run:

```bash
make deploy-kcp
```

Next, run `kubectl get deploy -n application-service-system` to validate that HAS was successfully deployed and synced to the workload cluster.

By default, Webhooks will **not** be installed with HAS. If you wish to install Webhooks on top of HAS, [please see this doc](./kcp-webhooks.md).

## Testing HAS

1) Open a new terminal window

2) Run `export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-kcp>/.kcp/data/admin.kubeconfig` to set your Kubeconfig to KCP

3) `kubectl create ns default` to create a namespace to use

4) Run `kubectl apply -f samples/application/hasapp.yaml` to create a simple Application resource

5) Run `kubectl get hasapp application-sample -o yaml`, and verify you see the following:
