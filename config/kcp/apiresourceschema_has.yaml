                    description: reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating
                      the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of
                      specific condition types may define expected values and meanings
                      for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed
                      API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may
                      not be empty.
